# Lab 1 — K-Means Parallelization in Python

K-Means clustering (on `enzyme` and `hydrofob`) over a synthetic proteins dataset, in serial, `multiprocessing` and `threading` versions, comparing execution times and speedup.

## Usage

```bash
python proteins-generator.py 50000 <seed>   # generates proteins.csv
python lab1-proteins-serial.py
python lab1-proteins-mp.py
python lab1-Proteins-th.py
```

Run from the folder containing `proteins.csv`. Datasets are not committed.
